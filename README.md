# Boilerplate Stack

Phase 1 scaffolding for the JSON-driven Supabase + Temporal starter.

## Screenshots

A live walkthrough of the running stack (`docker compose up -d`), captured from the deployment at http://localhost:3000.

### Local Models Playground
Small language models served locally in Docker. Models are grouped with the Microsoft Phi family first, each card showing parameters, on-disk size, quantization and "best for" guidance.

### Sales Force Automation CRM
A durable sales pipeline where every lead is a long-running **Temporal** workflow persisted to **Supabase**, with the local language model layered on top for drafting outreach, suggesting the next best action, summarizing deals and qualifying leads (BANT).

### System Monitoring
Live health for every service in the stack (Ollama, CRM API, Frontend, Temporal, Mailpit, Supabase DB) plus cumulative **token usage** captured from each local model request — totals, per-model breakdown and throughput.

### AI Chat
Streaming chat against any locally pulled model, with a model picker, stop control and copy/error states.

## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop with Compose v2
- `make` (comes with macOS/Linux; install via Xcode CLT on macOS)
- Node 18+ (optional for running the frontend outside Docker)
- Supabase CLI (optional) if you want the full Supabase stack locally

## Quick Start
1) Copy environment defaults  
   `cp .env.example .env`
2) Start everything  
   `make up`  
   (add `USE_DEV=1` for live-reload mounts)
3) Open services  
   - Frontend placeholder: http://localhost:3000  
   - Temporal UI: http://localhost:8080  
   - Temporal gRPC: localhost:7234  
   - Supabase Postgres stub: localhost:55432

Common commands:
- `make down` — stop containers
- `make reset` — tear down volumes and recreate containers
- `make logs` — stream all service logs
- `make logs-temporal` / `make logs-frontend` — targeted logs

## Local & Cloud SLM (Ollama)
A GPT‑style small language model runs locally in Docker and can be deployed to Azure.
- **Server:** `ollama` service on http://localhost:11434 (default model `qwen2.5:0.5b`; also `llama3.2:1b`, `gemma2:2b`)
- **Showcase UI:** http://localhost:8090/slm.html — live streaming demo with endpoint + model dropdowns
- **Cloud:** Bicep IaC under `infra/azure/` deploys Ollama to Azure Container Instances

Quick start:
```bash
docker compose up -d ollama ollama-pull   # start server + pull default model
```
See [docs/SLM.md](docs/SLM.md) for full architecture, model management, Azure deployment, API reference, and troubleshooting.
For a step‑by‑step local + Azure deployment walkthrough, see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## What’s Included (Phase 1)
- Docker Compose stack with Temporal server, UI, worker, frontend dev server, and stub Supabase Postgres
- Development overrides in `docker-compose.dev.yml` for live-reloading frontend and worker code
- Makefile wrappers for the usual lifecycle commands
- `.env.example` capturing required variables for frontend, Temporal, and Supabase placeholders

## Notes
- Supabase services are intentionally stubbed for Phase 1; use `supabase start --config supabase/config.toml` when you need the full Supabase stack.
- Frontend and Temporal code are minimal placeholders to keep containers healthy; replace with real implementations in Phases 2–3.
